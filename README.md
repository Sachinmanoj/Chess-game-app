Classic two-player Chess game application using Java program with rich Graphical User Interface

Abstract:

The scope of the project is to implement a classic two-player Chess game application using Java program with rich Graphical User Interface. The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece.

The chess board is represented in the simplest possible manner - as an 8 by 8 matrix, each containing a either a chess piece or a blank piece representing empty board space. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The game ends by making a checkmate to the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.

The application will have a home page with a ‘start’ button. Clicking the start button will take the user to the Chess game, with initial positions of the chess pieces. User can move a chess piece by clicking the same and clicking (second click) the position to move. Clicking a chess piece will highlight the possible moves and helps the user to choose a promising position. The highlighted possible moves will also include options to attack and capture opponent’s position. At the point of check set to the king by opponent, the user will be allowed to move only the positions which nullifies the check. At the point of checkmate, the application will auto detect the end of game and declares the winner.
